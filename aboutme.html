  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Versatility</h3>
  <p>is the name of the game. I grew up with a passion for <b>design</b>. Like everyone else, I took a great deal of joy in aesthetics, and like a select few, I taught myself in using creating and editing softwares and sought advice and critique to improve my style. I am an eternal student in <b>technology</b>. Growing up in an era when technology became integrated in our daily lives, I saw the infinite possibilities of technology. I graduated with a degree in <b>Computer Science</b>, with the goal of creating something that is functionally complete and aesthetically pleasing. During my pursuit of a degree, I took an active interest in <b>marketing</b>, <b>finance</b>, and <b>business</b>, while honing my <b>leadership</b> and <b>organizational</b> skills. Stacking my resume from these industries to broaden my horizon to better understand the world around me, I gained the versatility to be a <b>pragmatic visionary</b>. And to display my <b>experiences</b> and <b>philosophy</b>, while showcasing my skills in design and developing, I built this website.
