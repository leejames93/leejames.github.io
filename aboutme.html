  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Versatility</h3>
  <p>is the name of the game. I grew up with a passion for <b>design</b>. Like everyone else, I took a great deal of joy in aesthetics, and like a select few, I taught myself in using creating and editing softwares and sought advice and critique to improve my style. I am an eternal student in <b>technology</b>. Growing up in an era when technology became integrated in our daily lives, I saw the infinite possibilities of technology. I graduated with a degree in <b>Computer Science</b>, with the goal of creating something that is functionally complete and aesthetically pleasing. During my pursuit of a degree, I took an active interest in <b>marketing</b>, <b>finance</b>, and <b>business</b>, while honing my <b>leadership</b> and <b>organizational</b> skills. Stacking my resume from these industries to broaden my horizon to better understand the world around me, I gained the versatility to be a <b>pragmatic visionary</b>. And to display my <b>experiences</b> and <b>philosophy</b>, while showcasing my skills in design and developing, I built this website.

    <span class="border2">FIRST PRINCIPLES</span>
    <br>
    <p>the fundamental concepts or assumptions on which a theory, system, or method is based.<br><i>"You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there."</i><br>- Elon Musk</p>

<div class="strip">
  <p>Rather than whatever everybody else is doing, the most important thought was, what makes sense. The process of breaking a problem down to its most fundamental parts, and then reconstructing the pieces from the bottom up became key in the liberation from the creative cage that was developed while pursuing a CS degree. Web development allows me to show my artistic capability, while also demonstrating my ability to develop.</p>

  <p>The infamous "norman door" comes to mind whenever I think of poor design and poor user experience (UX). I came to understand the basics of UX while interning for an AR/VR start-up. With AR/VR's limitations, the greatest challenge was creating controls in a 360 degree immserve environment, without disrupting the experience. With observation and research, the team and I were able to find ways to improve user experience by implementing intuitive controls, all the while maintaining the immersive experience. These types of lessons have stuck with me and I methodologically think about it when creating a product.</p>
